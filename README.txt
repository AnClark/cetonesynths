The Cetone Synth series:
========================

Source code for some of my old VSTi synthesizers. Provided 'as is'
and license free for public use.

The projects won't build out-of-the box (makefile/project missing)
and you will need additional stuff (e.g. the VST SDK). But maybe 
these source codes can be of any help for VSTi/synth starters.

If you want to try them out, have a look here:

No VST host? Get one (IMHO the best) here:
